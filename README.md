<h2>Dynamic optimization of flight routs with n number of stops.</h2>
Target audience: Airlines and aviation industry .

Design Strategy:

Detect dots using get points function representing capitals of each state using image processing
 and assign them an id.



Create a node that represents each city(dot) using its coordinate location on the image.
Each node will contain a dictionary that uses the id of all the other nodes as a key and their 
distance from the  current node as a value and it will be sorted  in ascending order of the values.




Determine how many n closest neighboring cities each city will connect to. Get n as an input from the user.

Generate adjacency matrix to represent the connection of each node/city to n amount of neighboring cities.

Setup matrix used to generate and set up adjacency matrix
 which will represent the graph.

Dijkstra algorithm inside the Graph class. I used it to find the generate the shortest 
distance from one city to another.

This graph is generated by connecting each city to the four closest cities to it.

Using the first graph, the path from California to Maine is displayed with 12 stops between the two states.

This graph is generated by connecting each city to the nineteen closest cities to it.

Using the first graph, the path from California to Maine is displayed with two stops between the two states. by increasing the number of connection

<h1>Design Feature:</h1>

KD mapping GUI is used to get the inputs from the user.
Inputs consists of the start city and destination.

Using get rank function we can generate rank of the cities based on their connection. 
For four Closest cities Utah have the highest rank.

<h1>Special Function:</h1>

<h1>PageRank algorithm.</h1>

I used it to rate each city base on itâ€™s connections with another neighboring Cities.

<h1>Additional functions:</h1>

Distance function is used to find the Euclidean distance between two points.

Draw path function used to draw the generated path/route on the map and display it.
