<h2>Problem Statement: 
Dynamic optimization of flight routs with n number of stops.
Target audience: Airlines and aviation industry .<h2>

<h3>Design Strategy:

Detect dots using get points function representing capitals of each state using image processing
 and assign them an id.



Create a node that represents each city(dot) using its coordinate location on the image.
Each node will contain a dictionary that uses the id of all the other nodes as a key and their 
distance from the  current node as a value and it will be sorted  in ascending order of the values.




Determine how many n closest neighboring cities each city will connect to. Get n as an input from the user.

Generate adjacency matrix to represent the connection of each node/city to n amount of neighboring cities.

<h3>Setup matrix used to generate and set up adjacency matrix
 which will represent the graph.</h3>

<h3>Dijkstra algorithm inside the Graph class. I used it to find the generate the shortest 
distance from one city to another.</h3>

<h1>Design Feature:</h1>
<h3>
KD mapping GUI is used to get the inputs from the user.
Inputs consists of the start city and destination.</h3>

<h3>Using get rank function we can generate rank of the cities based on their connection. 
For four Closest cities Utah have the highest rank.</h3>

<h1>Special Function:</h1>
<h3>
PageRank algorithm.

I used it to rate each city base on itâ€™s connections with another neighboring Cities.</h3>

<h3>This graph is generated by connecting each city to the four closest cities to it.</h3>

<h3>Using the first graph, the path from California to Maine is displayed with 12 stops between the two states.

<h1>Additional functions:</h1>
<h3>
Distance function is used to find the Euclidean distance between two points.</h3>
